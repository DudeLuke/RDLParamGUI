# RDLParamGUI
A tool for editing Kirby's Return to Dream Land, Kirby Triple Deluxe, and Kirby Planet Robobot param archives

## Features
* Can open, edit, and save HEL Engine's generic param archive files
* Supports param labelling using a `labels.ini` file in the same directory as the exe
* Supports importing ini files to patch the currently-opened parameter archive
* Having a decompressed parameter archive named "Reference.bin" in the same directory as the exe sets that archive as the reference for automatically generating ini patch files based on the differences between the two archives.
